# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

I know a very small amount of python like how to create variables and loop syntax but thats about it. After this assignment, I've learned quite a bit about python's syntax and what you can and can't do, and I really like the language. From the very start, I've noticed that the language is more "readable" than Java, in almost every way. I noticed this especially in the syntax for looping through lists or strings, since it literally says for every object/character in this list/string, do something. I also like how dynamic lists are, and how you can append and pop. I'm looking forward to learning more about the intricate parts of python as we progress through this class. :D


2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I used AI effectively by asking it to explain concepts that I didn't understand. An example of a prompt I used was "Here is my code: (print(n + " is odd")), why does it give me an error when I try to compile my code?" It explained to me that in Python, when you concatenate integers with strings it doesn't automatically convert integers into strings like Java does. Since I've only ever had experience in Java and JS, I never knew this. It also taught me several ways to bypass this issue in python, one of these ways was by using formatted strings, which is a type of string that I thought was really convenient and am excited to use more in the future.

Another example of how I used AI effectively was by having AI explain how Python is an "indentation-based" language. I gave it the prompt "Here is my code: *insert code* when my code compiles, it keeps giving me an indentation error but I don't know how to fix it. Please explain how indentation works in Python to somebody who is a beginner." When I was doing the problem where I check a list of grades and return a list of the letter grade that corresponds to the numeric value, I was having issue with the code because I was coding it as if it was Java. I was indenting each nested if statement for each grade. AI explained that this was what was causing the issue, as Python bases its structure of code on the indented space between lines. It also taught me that "else if" doesn't exist in Python, and that it is instead elif, even when that wasn't a part of my oriinal prompt.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

The concepts that were the most challenging 

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
