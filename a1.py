MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[Paste the prompt you used to generate your problem set here]

I'm learning the basics of Python programming in a high school programming class.
I have experience with Java, as I took APCSA and passed it last year without thinking
it was too difficult. Can you create 5-7 problems that cover
 > - Variables and basic data types 
 > - Conditionals (if/elif/else) 
 > - Loops (for and while) 
 > - Functions 
 > - Basic list operations 
Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs."

"""
PROBLEM 1: Welcome Message Generator (Variables & Strings)
Task: Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a welcome message.
Example Input:
name = "Alex"
age = 16
Example Output:
Welcome, Alex! You are 16 years old.

name = input("Enter name: ")
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
print(f"Welcome, {name}! You are {age} years old.)

PROBLEM 2: Even or Odd Checker (Conditionals)
Write a function check_even_odd(num) that takes an integer and prints whether it is even or odd.
Ex Input:
check_even_odd(7)
Ex Output:
7 is odd.

def check_even_odd(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(n + "is odd")
    else:
        print(n + "is even")

PROBLEM 3: Sum of First N Numbers (Loops)
Task: Write a program that asks the user for a number n and calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a for loop.
Example Input:
Enter a number: 5
Example Output:
The sum of the first 5 numbers is 15.

n = int(input("Enter number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += i
return sum



Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
